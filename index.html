            <p>The hybrid hypercar took <strong class="time_or_with">6:35.183 minutes to travel through the Green Hell on October 28 at 5:14 p.m.</strong> The person in charge of completing the record lap was <strong class="person">Maro Engel</strong>, a German driver who knows very well what it means to go flat out on the German circuit, since he <strong class="what">won the 24 Hours of Nürburgring in 2016</strong> with the help of another illustrious Mercedes driver: Bernd Schneider .
                <br>
                <br>   
        To achieve the record, Engel had to work hard and make the most of the electrical contribution <strong class="time_or_with"> of the hybrid propulsion system of the Mercedes-AMG One</strong> , derived from the German manufacturer's Formula 1.

                <br>
            <p>Max Verstappen is special... we all know that. He is also a true fan of racing and motorsports. But is it really that big of a deal? It is not strange to think so when the Red Bull driver has participated in the <strong class="what">Formula 1 Emilia Romagna GP and the virtual 24 Hours of Nürburgring in the same weekend</strong> . And not only that, but he has won both tests! Truly, this guy's thing is something from another planet...
                <br>
                <br>
            This weekend, in addition to the Formula 1 Emilia Romagna Grand Prix, the virtual Nürburgring 24 Hours took place. The team supported by Max Verstappen, Team Redline, was present at the test and the Dutchman, despite his commitments to F1 in Imola, participated in the race with his teammates<strong class="person">Diogo Pinto, Christopher Lulham and Florian Lebigre</strong> .
                <br>
                <br>
            Aboard a <strong class="time_or_with">M4 GT3 –specifically number 20</strong> –, Max completed his first stint last night, after <strong class="what"> tacking Pole a few hours earlier at the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari</strong>.
                <br>
                <br>
            In any case, the most curious thing is that it was he who placed the #20 car at the top of the table, since until then they were running in third position.
                <br>
                <br>
            His second and final relay took place early this morning. <strong class="person">Max Verstappen</strong took the controls of the simulator to further increase the distance with respect to his pursuers, something that has made the work of the other members of the #20 car easier, since they have<strong class="what">finally taken the victory with 36 seconds of advantage over the second classified</strong>. 
                <br>
                <br>
            It seems unbelievable that this really happened. In any case, this is not the first time that the current <strong class="what">Formula 1 world champion and the winner of the race in Imola this Sunday participates in a 'simracing' race at the same time that a Grand Prix of the category is being held</strong>. Queen of motorsports. <strong class="what">It has already done so in Saudi Arabia and, in principle, the Hungarian event will be combined with the virtual 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps</strong>.
                <br>
                <br>
            <strong class="person">Verstappen is a racing 'crazy'erstappen is a racing 'crazy'</strong> has a simulator on his own private jet! Perhaps this 'little world' will serve you, in addition to training, as a fun element with which you can escape from your problems and then perform better in 'real life'.v</p>
